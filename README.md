## Automatically generate components and screens

we are using [plop.js](https://plopjs.com/) to generate components and screens using command line in matter of seconds.

in your terminal run ,

```bash
yarn generate
```

this will prompt you to choose a generator  
1Ô∏è‚É£ common component\
2Ô∏è‚É£ screen\
3Ô∏è‚É£ screen specific component

1Ô∏è‚É£ for common component it will ask for the component name and create the new common component with basic code structure at

```bash
|--src
   |--components
      |--ComponentName
         |--ComponentName.tsx
         |--ComponentName.styles.ts
```

it will also export it from index.js Automatically

2Ô∏è‚É£ for screens it will ask for the screen name and create the new screen with basic code structure at

```bash
|--src
   |--screens
      |--ScreenName
         |--ScreenName.tsx
         |--ScreenName.styles.ts
```

it will also export it from index.js Automatically

3Ô∏è‚É£ for screen specific component it will ask for the screen name which this component belongs to and then it will ask for the component name then it will create the new component with basic code structure inside that specific screen's component folder

```bash
|--src
   |--screens
      |--ScreenName
         |--components
            |--ComponentName.tsx
